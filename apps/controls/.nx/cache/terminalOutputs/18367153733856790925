Error: [readCachedProjectGraph] ERROR: No cached ProjectGraph is available.

If you are leveraging \`readCachedProjectGraph()\` directly then you will need to refactor your usage to first ensure that
the ProjectGraph is created by calling \`await createProjectGraphAsync()\` somewhere before attempting to read the data.

If you encounter this error as part of running standard \`nx\` commands then please open an issue on https://github.com/nrwl/nx
